## what

this is an ongoing journal/dump of thoughts as I go through my [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) Fall 2 2023 (sep-dec) batch.

## projects

- day 0 - [2600 covers](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/2600-covers)

---

(ongoing)

- [nyc noise](https://nyc-noise.com/) -- work with [Jessica](https://jessica-hallock.com/) on rebuilding i.e. moving away from wordpress. probably django? with mayyybe next.js middle/frontend on netlify to make it super snazzy (+will let us have micro js things)

## maybe projects (in no particular order)

- "rankist" - drop a bunch of files? or text lines? and be asked which you prefer until you rank them in some order
- laughing / dying maps - a map of everyone laughing / dying / ... in real time
- plist web viewer - drop one or multiple files, get them in xml/json into your clipboard (all browser based)
- exif web viewer - same as plist, all browser based, for one or multiple images
- sqlite - same as plist/exif, export as csv
- pong a day - inspired by Pippin Barr's [Pongs](https://pippinbarr.com/pongs/info/), make a number of variations on some """easily understandable""" game. something to do with pushing a ball into a net (with physics/gravity/3d??) but some element of the game is distorted? something simpler?
- mp3s cannot loop - PSA/educational site/dive into mp3 format/looping/ableton default export, etc.
- dead maps - map of dead restaurants/institutions in/around new york. gotta find the draft for this project which I should have somewhere but can't find right now.
- suggestions for [1940s.nyc](https://1940s.nyc/) - suggest/open PR to make site more PWA-/gps-friendly..?
- secret movie project - more soon!
- weird zoom/online chat with face detection? I had a draft in march 2020 - is this still something I want to do
- alternatives to css - artistic-y/creative-y alternatives to css /// port of alternatives to web? swiftui for web? qt for web?
- like typeracer but for regex
- secret project around food (it's worth the wait/reveal, hopefully)
- not using clustering in maps -- very hot topic for me. educational/PSA/mapping
- how to run django on a $5 digital ocean vps i.e. how to not use heroku/render? this will be exciting for me because my default of using heroku/render is ruinuous. will dokku ([suggested to me on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37492560)) the solution I've been looking for all my life?
- audio "api" generator - not really an api -- more a comedy project, but exciting nevertheless
- something that tracks how many times I open gmail per day (I don't want to know)
- something about digital smells?
- something about restaurant reviews?
- minivac 601 emulator!!! is this the ultime rabbit hole will I ever emerge back from it??
- a le sphinx (old school) crypto device emulator?
- something about a small project manifesto?
- a game about being sorry that will hopefully not make me be even more sorry (it's a gamble I'm ready to take!)

## books/links/things I'd like to study/go through

- learn more lisp i.e. go through little schemer?

## notes for myself, kinda

- two new shortcuts I made for myself:
  - `ghissue` opens a github issue in the current repo via the gh CLI command -> `alias ghissue='(){gh issue create --title "$1" --body "";}'` in my `.bash_aliases`
  - `g addpush` is a git alias in `.gitconfig` which does `git add . && git commit -m "." && git push` which is terrible, horrible, not-good form but also gets the job done.

## inspiration

[John Carmack's .plan archives](https://github.com/oliverbenns/john-carmack-plan) -- how to get there using some super simple tools..? is this Recurse's "checkins" channel? i.e. posting to that channel is... enough?

## ongoing background projects (moving this to the very bottom so that I remember that I didn't come to RC to work on these - kinda.)

this is a list of projects that I already have going on and will either come back to / dedicate some time to, or maybe leave alone for a longer while:

- [chrome gmail dictation extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dictation-for-gmail/eggdmhdpffgikgakkfojgiledkekfdce) -- upkeep, manifest v4, analytics
- [la parlure - collaborative french-canadian expression dictionary](https://www.laparlure.com/) - unsure but improve it (move away from heroku to save costs?)
- [dico2rue - collaborative french-french expression dictionary](https://dico2rue.com/) - need to make it actually collaborative & relaunch it properly!!
- [kriller](https://kriller.com/) - move to a smaller host?
