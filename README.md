### ongoing things

- [nyc noise](https://nyc-noise.com/) -- work with [Jessica](https://jessica-hallock.com/) on rebuilding i.e. moving away from wordpress. probably django? with mayyybe next.js middle/frontend on netlify to make it super snazzy (+will let us have micro js things) -> this is happening [here](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/nycnoise)!
  - AND... a ticketing system.....?????????

## infinite pool of maybe-projects (in order of kinda faves first + then random)

- alternatives to css - artistic-y/creative-y alternatives to css /// port of alternatives to web? swiftui for web? qt for web?
- mp3s cannot loop - PSA/educational site/dive into mp3 format/looping/ableton default export, etc.
- better PWA support for [1940s.nyc](https://1940s.nyc/) - this [issue/discussion](https://github.com/jboolean/1940s.nyc/issues/876)
- audio "api" generator - not really an api -- more a comedy project, but exciting nevertheless
- secret movie project - more soon!
- secret project around food (it's worth the wait/reveal, hopefully)
- not using clustering in maps -- very hot topic for me. educational/PSA/mapping
- "rankist" - drop a bunch of files? or text lines? and be asked which you prefer until you rank them in some order
- like typeracer but for regex
- exif web viewer and/or cleaner! - same as plist, all browser based, for one or multiple images
- sqlite - same as plist/exif, export as csv
- pong a day - inspired by Pippin Barr's [Pongs](https://pippinbarr.com/pongs/info/), make a number of variations on some """easily understandable""" game. something to do with pushing a ball into a net (with physics/gravity/3d??) but some element of the game is distorted? something simpler?
- weird zoom/online chat with face detection? I had a draft in march 2020 - is this still something I want to do
- something that tracks how many times I open gmail per day (I don't want to know)
- something about digital smells?
- something about restaurant reviews?
- a le sphinx (old school) crypto device emulator?
- something about a small project manifesto?
- which day of recurse is it? day 0? day 14? basically [this calendar](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/workdays.html?d1=18&m1=9&y1=2023&d2=8&m2=12&y2=2023&ti=on&) but telling me where I am in-batch. this feels like not a good time investment to make & goes against the idea of taking it day by day, etc.

## notes for myself, kinda

- new shortcuts I made for myself:
  - `ghissue` opens a github issue in the current repo via the gh CLI command -> `alias ghissue='(){gh issue create --title "$1" --body "";}'` in my `.bash_aliases` -- I've never used it
  - `g addpush` is a git alias in `.gitconfig` which does `git add . && git commit -m "." && git push` which is terrible, horrible, not-good form but also gets the job done. -- I use it ALL the time
  - `gregtechcname (subdomain)` to quickly create a .greg.technology subdomain and add a CNAME file to the current repo/dir ----- for example, [https://plist.greg.technology](https://plist.greg.technology) and [https://eaafa.greg.technology](https://eaafa.greg.technology) and [https://2600.greg.technology](https://2600.greg.technology) and [https://invest.greg.technology](https://invest.greg.technology) and [https://fastlendly.greg.technology](https://fastlendly.greg.technology) and [https://pdf.greg.technology](https://pdf.greg.technology) ---- I think CNAMEs are so so great. -- I use it for all of my projects it's great
  - django bash shortcuts: `djmigrations` to makemigrations, `djmigrate` to migrate, `djrun` to runserver - not that useful
- femto tools I made:
  - a plugin for [xbar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar) that watches the deployment status of my services on render.com and shows them in the menubar -> [code here](https://gist.github.com/gregsadetsky/7e4f040989d7792c3191316174409670)!
- this is the best thing ever since I use vite for everything now -->> https://github.com/skywarth/vite-github-pages-deployer
  - here's me [using it](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/rctv-app-blog-article/blob/main/.github/workflows/vite-github-pages-deploy.yaml) in the wild!

## inspiration

- [John Carmack's .plan archives](https://github.com/oliverbenns/john-carmack-plan) -- how to get there using some super simple tools..? is this Recurse's "checkins" channel? i.e. posting to that channel is... enough?
- "surround yourself with the mess of what you love" - austin kleon (quote offered to me by [Aditya](https://github.com/adityaathalye) -- thanks!!)

## ongoing background projects (moving this to the very bottom to remind myself that I didn't come to RC to work on these even though I still care about these projects a lot)

this is a list of projects that I already have going on and will either come back to / dedicate some time to, or maybe leave alone for a longer while:

- [chrome gmail dictation extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dictation-for-gmail/eggdmhdpffgikgakkfojgiledkekfdce) -- upkeep, manifest v4, analytics -- actually working on this too!
- [kriller](https://kriller.com/) - move to a smaller host? kinda working on this too!
- [la parlure - collaborative french-canadian expression dictionary](https://www.laparlure.com/) - unsure but improve it (move away from heroku to save costs?)
- [dico2rue - collaborative french-french expression dictionary](https://dico2rue.com/) - need to make it actually collaborative & relaunch it properly!!
