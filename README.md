## what

this is an ongoing journal/dump of thoughts as I go through my [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) Fall 2 2023 (sep-dec) batch.

## projects

- day 0 - [2600 covers](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/2600-covers)

## ongoing background projects

this is a list of projects that I already have going on and will either come back to / dedicate some time to, or maybe leave alone for a longer while:

- [chrome gmail dictation extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dictation-for-gmail/eggdmhdpffgikgakkfojgiledkekfdce) -- upkeep, manifest v4, analytics
- [la parlure - collaborative french-canadian expression dictionary](https://www.laparlure.com/) - unsure but improve it (move away from heroku to save costs?)
- [dico2rue - collaborative french-french expression dictionary](https://dico2rue.com/) - need to make it actually collaborative & relaunch it properly!!
